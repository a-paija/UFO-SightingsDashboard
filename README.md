<h1>UFO Sightings Dashboard</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
An interactive Tableau project visualizing 80,000+ UFO sightings across the United States (1949–2014). The dashboard transforms raw data into a clear, engaging story of when, where, and how UFOs were reported, allowing users to uncover geographic and temporal patterns through interactive exploration.

<h2>How to Use</h2>

1. Download the .twbx Tableau workbook from this repository or click the Tableau Public link to view online.
   - [Tableau Public WebLink](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ajin.paija/viz/UnitedStatesUFOdata/Dashboard1)

3. Open it in Tableau Desktop or Tableau Public.

4. Interact with the dashboard by clicking on states or years to filter across views.

<h2>Key Features</h2>

- UFO Sightings by State (Map): Geographic distribution of sightings across the U.S.

- Top 10 States (Pie Chart): Highlights states with the most reports, including an “Other” slice for all remaining states.

- Top UFO Shapes (Packed Bubbles): Displays the most frequently reported UFO shapes.

- Sightings by Year (Bar Chart): Reveals trends, spikes, and declines in sightings over time.

- Interactive Filters: Clicking on a state or year automatically updates all other visualizations.

- Dynamic Titles: Dashboard titles adjust based on selections for clarity and context.


<h2>Dataset:</h2>

 <b> The dataset includes over 80,000 records with the following fields: </b>
 
- Date and time of sighting

- City, state, and country

- UFO shape and duration
  
- Witness comments

- Latitude and longitude

- Note: This project focuses only on U.S. states.

<h2>Insights</h2>

1. Shapes of UFOs: The most common reported forms are light, circle, and sphere, suggesting many sightings are linked to luminous or simple geometric phenomena. Less frequent shapes like cigar and triangle indicate a wide variety of public perceptions.

2. Sightings Over Time: UFO reports increased significantly after 1998, peaking in 2012 with over 8,000 sightings. A sharp decline followed in 2013–2014, which may reflect changes in media attention, reporting platforms, or public interest.

3. Geographic Distribution: Sightings are concentrated in California, Florida, Texas, Arizona, and Washington, but they are not limited to these states. Population density appears to play a role in the volume of reports.

4. Top 10 States vs. Others: While the top 10 states dominate UFO reporting, the “Other” category remains large, showing that sightings are a nationwide phenomenon rather than isolated events.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

- UFO reporting is shaped by population size, cultural interest, and media exposure.

- The dominance of luminous shapes suggests that many reports may involve natural or man-made light phenomena.

- Despite clustering in certain states, UFO sightings remain a widespread and persistent cultural phenomenon across the U.S.
